# Task List

This Laravel project represents a fundamental showcase of my development proficiency. It's a minimalist task list application enabling users to manipulate tasks by adding, editing, or removing them. Tasks can be categorized as completed or not completed. This project serves as the starting point in a series of Laravel projects, showcasing the progression of my skills from basic to intermediate levels.
